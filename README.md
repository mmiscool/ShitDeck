# ShitDeck
Its like Stream deck but crappier and free.

I threw this together in under 2 hours as an example using autoit as autoit is a great general purpose macro program for windows. 
Run the program and load up your PCs ip address in the web browser on your mobile device. 

Replace the icon fils in "www/icons" to use custom icons.

Edit the macros in the "macros" folder to set up functions to be run when hitting a button.

See https://www.autoitscript.com/autoit3/docs/license.htm for the licence to Autoit included in this package.
